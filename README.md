## Nomnivor

Nomnivor is an app that allows people to find restaurants that cater to their specific dietary restrictions.

Users search a location or use their current location, select their dietary requirements -
e.g vegitarian - and the app returns matching restaurants.

As this is very much a first version, data for new restaurants must be manually added by users and also utilises the Foursquare API for additional restaurant data.

Hopefully more functionality will be added soon to improve the app and make it more useful.

### Known issues

* Currently app doesn't handle correctly the removal/re-displaying of exisitng restaurants when making multiple searches.
* Map not resizing properly to display all found restaurants.
